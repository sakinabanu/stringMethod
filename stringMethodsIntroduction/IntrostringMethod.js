/*
JAVASCRIPT SCRIPT METHODS :
In JavaScript, strings are used to represent and work with a sequence of characters. 
A string can represent an object as well as the primitive data type. 
Each method has a unique function that performs a change or calculation to our string and saves us from writing complex maniplulations from scratch.
They are 27 methods.
